  description: `# TLC Configuration

The \`.cfg\` file tells TLC **how** to check your specification. Let's look at what goes in it.

## INIT and NEXT

The most basic configuration specifies which definitions are the initial state and next-state relation:

\`\`\`
INIT Init
NEXT Next
\`\`\`

## INVARIANT

Properties that must hold in **every** reachable state:

\`\`\`
INVARIANT TypeOK
INVARIANT NoDeadlock
\`\`\`

If TLC finds a state where an invariant is FALSE, it reports an error with a trace showing how it got there.

## CONSTANT

Assign values to the constants declared in your spec:

\`\`\`
CONSTANT N = 3
CONSTANT Procs = {p1, p2, p3}
\`\`\`

## PROPERTY (Temporal Properties)

For liveness checks (things that must **eventually** happen):

\`\`\`
PROPERTY Liveness
\`\`\`

## SYMMETRY

When constants represent interchangeable processes, symmetry reduces the state space:

\`\`\`
CONSTANT Procs = {p1, p2, p3}
SYMMETRY Perms
\`\`\`

Where \`Perms\` is defined as \`Permutations(Procs)\` in your spec.

## CHECK_DEADLOCK

By default, TLC checks for deadlocks (states with no successor). You can disable this:

\`\`\`
CHECK_DEADLOCK FALSE
\`\`\`

## Try It

Try editing the configuration on the right. Change the constant \`Size\` to different values and see how the state space changes.`,

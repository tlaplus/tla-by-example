# Module Structure

Every TLA+ specification lives inside a **module**. A module is delimited by a header and a footer:

```
---- MODULE MySpec ----
(* your spec goes here *)
========================
```

## The Header

The header line starts with four or more dashes, followed by `MODULE`, the module name, and four or more dashes:

```
---- MODULE MySpec ----
```

Any text before the header is ignored by TLA+ tools. This is commonly used to provide a description of the specification, what it models, its purpose, or any assumptions.

The module name **must match the filename**. A module named `MySpec` must live in a file called `MySpec.tla`. TLC will report an error if they don't match.

## The Footer

The footer is a line of four or more equals signs:

```
========================
```

Everything after the footer is ignored by TLA+ tools. By convention, this space is used to record **modifications and updates** to the spec - a change log of what was modified and why:

```
========================
Modification History
* Added Bound invariant to limit state space
* Initial version with basic counter
```

## EXTENDS

The `EXTENDS` keyword imports definitions from other modules. You'll almost always extend at least one standard module:

```
EXTENDS Naturals, Sequences
```

Common standard modules:
- **Naturals** - natural numbers and arithmetic (+, -, *, \div, %)
- **Integers** - integers (adds negative numbers)
- **Sequences** - sequence operations (Append, Head, Tail, Len)
- **FiniteSets** - Cardinality, IsFiniteSet
- **TLC** - TLC-specific operators (Print, Assert)

## Separator Lines

Inside a module, you can use separator lines (four or more dashes) to visually organize your spec:

```
----
```

These have no semantic meaning - they're just for readability.

## Try It

The spec on the right shows a module with text before the header and after the footer. Notice how the module name matches the tab filename. Try modifying it and running TLC to see what happens.
